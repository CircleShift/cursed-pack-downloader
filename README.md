# cursed-pack-downloader

Tired of pesky curseforge packs being too hard to download without the launcher?

Want a cursed solution to the problem of clicking through many links to download all the mods in the modpack?

Have I got a solution for you!

Simply open the index.html file in a web browser, and select the manifest.json and modlist.html of the pack you are trying to download.  Next, click the "Start" button.  Then, every time you click "Next 15", 15 new tabs will open automatically.  Each of these tabs is a download link for one of the mods in the pack.  Once you go through all of them no more will open.

Enjoy!
